_OPMagazine_ is a Sydney-based independent news organisation dedicated to giving readers all sides of a story. We provide news reports and analysis on key issues, both national and international, while allowing readers to make up their own minds.

We believe strongly in the role of quality journalism in democracy. This is why we will always remain independent, and put news before profits.

We aim to inspire critical engagement with the world we live in, and set the stage for those important conversations.

**_OPMagazine_: think big with news you can trust.**
